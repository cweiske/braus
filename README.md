## Braus
A small application to select a browser every time you click a link anywhere. This is especially useful if you have multiple browsers or profiles, and you want to be able to open certain links in certain browsers. Very useful for web developers, but also for a lot of other people.

GNU/Linux alternative to apps such as Choosy/Browserchooser

A package is available for Archlinux [in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/braus-git/)

If you wish to package the app for your distro, please open an issue and we'll work on it together.

#### Build instructions
````
meson build --prefix=/usr
cd build
ninja
ninja install

````

When you run braus for the first time, it will ask you whether you want to set it as your default browser. Ideally you should make it default to actually get the benefit of an app like this.


### Add a browser profile
To add a new entry to the Braus browser selector, create a `.desktop` file
in `~/.local/share/applications/`.
It needs to handle `MimeType`s of `x-scheme-handler/https`.

Example:

    [Desktop Entry]
    Version=1.1
    Type=Application
    Name=Firefox Company
    Icon=firefox-symbolic
    Exec=firefox -P companyprofile %u
    Actions=
    Categories=WebBrowser;X-GNOME-WebApplications;
    MimeType=text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml+xml;application/xml;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https;x-scheme-handler/ftp;x-scheme-handler/chrome;application/x-xpinstall;

After creating the file, the desktop file cache needs to be updated:

    $ update-desktop-database  ~/.local/share/applications/
